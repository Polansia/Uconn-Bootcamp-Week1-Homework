# Uconn-Bootcamp-Week1-Homework

In this homework, I fixed a lot of the uneccesary code and made it alot more concice. I halved the ammunt of classes being used in the code while also making it easier to follow by using a variety of Semantic Tags as well as fixing up the general presentation of the code. I also added alt tags, fixed the title to something non-generic, and fixed the organization of the code.
